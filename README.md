# K-Means

I have started studying clustering techniques and, of course, k-means is the first one. 
In this code I have used the absenteeism data from UCI repository. I have used k-means to separate employees by the time the have worked
on the company and the absenteeism time. At first it was not possible to notice this, just by looking at the data, after clustering
it became clear how people with less time of service in the company were the ones with more absenteeism time.

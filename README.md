# K-Means

I have started studying clustering techniques and, of course, k-means is the first one. 
In this code I have used the absenteeism data from UCI repository. I have used k-means to separate employees by the time they have worked
for the company and the absenteeism time. At first it was not possible to notice this, just by looking at the data, but after clustering
it became clear how people with less time of service in the company were the ones staying away from work more frequently.
